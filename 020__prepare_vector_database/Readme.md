## Install PSQL

In order to interact with our Postgres database we will need to install the postgres client

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client -y
```

## Load Data into Databaase 

- We will enable vector extension
- We will setup our tables

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/setup.sql
```

- We will insert our database

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/insert.sql
```
> ⚠️ This file is autogenerated with a timestamp so you'll need to autocomplete eg. ./bin/execute ./sql/insert-1751397185.sql 

- Will will create our indexes

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/indexes.sql
```

These warnings is due to our low amount of data.
In our production use-case we need to have indexes.

```sh
psql:sql/indexes.sql:9: NOTICE:  ivfflat index created with little data
DETAIL:  This will cause low recall.
HINT:  Drop the index until the table has more data.
CREATE INDEX
psql:sql/indexes.sql:11: NOTICE:  ivfflat index created with little data
DETAIL:  This will cause low recall.
HINT:  Drop the index until the table has more data.
CREATE INDEX
```
